## Supported boards

<sub>\* Requires manually resetting the board into firmware upload mode by holding BOOT, pressing & releasing RESET, then releasing BOOT prior to upload. After uploading is successful, either press & release RESET or power cycle the board to put it in normal operation mode.</sub>

### ESP32-C3 partition layout

The default `esp32_c3` environment uses `no_ota.csv`. This gives the 4MB ESP32-C3 boards a larger single app partition for the current firmware and web feature set. Without this layout, the firmware can outgrow the default OTA app slot and the board may repeatedly reset before `setup()` runs.

Because this layout changes the flash partition table, erase the board before uploading firmware built with it:

```sh
pio run -t erase -e esp32_c3
pio run -t upload -e esp32_c3
pio run -t uploadfs -e esp32_c3
```

After flashing, monitor the C3 environment at `460800` baud:

```sh
pio device monitor -e esp32_c3 -b 460800
```

The erase step clears saved settings, Wi-Fi credentials, NVS data, and the filesystem. Upload both firmware and filesystem afterward.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies
    - [PlatformIO Core CLI](https://platformio.org/install/cli)
    - [Node Version Mananger](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
    - [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) (Only required if contributing code)
1. [Download](https://github.com/jhoff/Split-Flap-Display/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone this [git repository](https://github.com/jhoff/Split-Flap-Display).
1. Open a terminal and `cd` to the project root
1. Install required version of npm for the project - `nvm install`
1. Install build dependencies - `npm install`
1. Connect the ESP32 to your computer using a USB cable.
1. Build everything and upload to the board - `npm run build`

- Automatically formats all source code ( `npm run format` - if needed )
- Compiles and minifies all frontend assets ( `npm run assets` )
- Downloads all required arduino / esp32 libraries
- Compiles and uploads the esp32 firmware ( `npm run pio:firmware` or `pio run -t upload -e <environment>` )
- Compiles and uploads the littlefs filesystem ( `npm run pio:filesystem` or `pio run -t uploadfs -e <environment>` )

If you are switching an ESP32-C3 board from an older build or partition layout, use the erase/upload sequence in [ESP32-C3 partition layout](#esp32-c3-partition-layout) instead of only running `npm run build`.

1. Enjoy!

## Multi-Display Master Mode

The firmware can coordinate multiple split-flap display groups from one master controller. This is useful when a single hardware group cannot exceed 8 modules, but the full message needs to span more modules.

Limits:

- Up to 8 modules per group
- Up to 6 groups total
- Up to 48 modules total when all 6 groups have 8 modules
- Group 1 is always the local group connected to the master controller
- Groups 2-6 are remote groups controlled over ESP-NOW

All controllers run the same firmware. The master is simply the controller where `Number of Groups` is set above `1`.

### How messages are split

When custom text is submitted from the master web page, the text is split from left to right using each group's configured module count.

For example, with these group sizes:

| Group | Modules | Displayed segment |
| ----- | ------- | ----------------- |
| 1     | 8       | Characters 1-8    |
| 2     | 6       | Characters 9-14   |
| 3     | 8       | Characters 15-22  |

Group 1 displays its segment locally on the master controller. The master sends each remaining segment to the configured remote group MAC address over ESP-NOW. Short segments are padded with spaces. Characters beyond the total configured module count are not sent.

### Setup

1. Flash the firmware and filesystem to every group controller.
1. Configure Wi-Fi on every controller. Using the same Wi-Fi network is recommended so the controllers share a radio channel and each web page remains reachable.
1. Open the serial monitor for each remote controller and note the MAC address printed at startup (also shown on the Settings page):

    - `[esp-now] initialized on AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`

1. On the master controller, open `Settings`.
1. In `Hardware Settings`, set `Number of Modules` to the number of modules physically connected to the master group.
1. In `Multi-Display Master`, set `Number of Groups`.
1. For each group:

    - Set the module count for that group.
    - Leave Group 1 as the local display.
    - Enter the ESP-NOW MAC address for each remote group.

1. Save settings.
1. Return to the main page, select `Custom Text`, enter the full message, and click `Update Display`.

Remote groups automatically switch into ESP-NOW remote display mode when they receive a message from the master. They do not need their own text entry once registered with the master.

## Tuning

The settings page provides two levels of offset adjustment for precise flap alignment:

### Module Offsets

Each module has a coarse offset that adjusts the home position (magnet detection point). This shifts all characters on that module by the same amount. Use this when an entire module's display is consistently off by a few steps. Changes take effect immediately after saving settings.

### Character Offsets

Each character on each module can be individually tuned. This is useful when specific characters are misaligned while others are correct. In the settings page:

1. Expand the module you want to tune
2. Use the ▲/▼ arrows or enter values directly to adjust each character's position by individual motor steps
3. Use **Reset** to zero all offsets for a module
4. Use **Copy from** to duplicate another module's offsets

Changes take effect immediately after saving settings—no reboot required. Offsets are stored per-module and persist across reboots.

### Create your feature

1. Start a new branch with a descriptive name.
1. Compile and upload your changes

- `npm run pio:firmware` or `pio run -t upload -e <environment>` to compile firmware and upload
- `npm run pio:filesystem` or `pio run -t uploadfs -e <environment>` to compile the filesystem from `src/web` and upload
- You can do both together using `npm run pio` or `pio run -t upload -t uploadfs -e <environment>`

1. When ready, commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
1. Open a pull request to this repository.

### Running Tests

The project includes unit tests for the frontend JavaScript logic. Tests use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with jsdom environment.

Run all tests:

```sh
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode (re-runs on file changes):

```sh
npm run test:watch
```

Tests cover the Alpine.js component logic including settings management, character offset calculations, and API interactions with mocked fetch calls.
